    This script is written for Unity 3D Engine.
    Unity 3D Version: Unity 5.x
    
    
    INFO: This script moves the Directional Light as the Sun in your scene to the right position corresponding to the real-world location of the light source.
    This is to ensure that Image Effects like "Sun Shafts" work as expected and apply effects properly. The Sun position will be updated during run-time & also in the Editor.
