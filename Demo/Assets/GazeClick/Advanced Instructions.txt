Here is a step by step instruction on what you should do:


0. Have a running unity project (keep Unity open).

1. Add Google VR to that Unity project. Here are the official instructions: https://developers.google.com/vr/unity/get-started


Alternatively here is what we do:

1.1 Download the Google VR unity package from https://developers.google.com/vr/unity/download
1.2 Double Click the GoogleVRForUnity.unitypackage after it is fully downloaded
1.3 In Unity a window will open ask you if you want to import the package. Click import.
1.4 After importing the files, Unity may open another window asking you if you want to import plugins. Import them.
1.5 Make sure your project does not show any errors and the scene runs without incidents.

Now you want to have a scene which has the required GoogleVR prefabs. Either copy or use the demo scene under GoogleVR/Demos/Scenes/GVRDemo or add the necessarily prefabs to your scene:

1.6 Drag the GvrMain prefab (Under GoogleVR/Prefabs) into the scene (Hierarchy).
1.7 Drag the GVRReticle prefab (Under GoogleVR/Prefabs/UI) into the scene (Hierarchy) place it directly under GVRMain/Head/Main Camera .
1.8 If no GvrPointerManager script is in your scene add it to your GVRMain object. (This is needed to receive Click events).
1.9 Make sure your project is working (running without errors) and you see a point/circle in the middle of the screen when running the prepared scene.
1.10 Make sure the objects in your scene are clickable! (Either are buttons, or have EventTriggers for PointerClick or implement the interface IPointerClickHandler).

2. Add our plugin you the Unity project.
2.1 Buy our plugin in the Unity Asset store under http://u3d.as/EPb
2.2 Download the plugin.
2.3 Import the plugin into unity. (Either through the Unity Asset Store tab or by double clicking the downloaded package.)
2.4 Say yes to the import. (You should get a message in the "Console" in Unity saying GoogleVR version found.)
2.5 Drag and drop the GazeClick prefab (directly in the folder GazeClick) into the hierarchy of your scene (it does not matter where).

3. Your done! You can now use the GazeClick in this scene. If you want it to work in another scene open the other scene and do steps 1.6, 1.7, 2.5.

4. Use GazeClick / GoogleVR:
4.1 Press the run button. 
4.2 Press ALT (and keep it pressed) while moving your mouse to look around.
4.3 Look on an interactive object (like a button).
4.4 Keep looking on the same object (without too much movement) for a while to click it.
